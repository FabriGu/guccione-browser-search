The two pieces in the collection aim to showcase that often innovation is forced into fashion and generates articles of clothing that can be inconvenient to wear and provide no additional functionality. I designed and sewed the pieces myself, created 3D printed custom parts and mechanisms for the project, as well as put together all the electronic components and the code that made them function.",

Participants step on a floor switch to trigger a countdo wn sequence, after which their por trait is captured, processed, and a single random cell is extracted from a 7×7 grid (overlaid on their face using ml5 face tr acking). This cell is printed on thermal paper using a custom dithering algorithm that converts full-color images to black and white while preserving visual quality. Participants then place their printed cell fragment on the corresponding coordinate of an illuminated lightbox display, gradually building a composite community portrait over time. As new contributions accumulate, earlier portraits become partially obscured, creating a layered timeline of collective portraits that visualizes the ever changing community identity. The project challenges self-representation by blurring the lines of individual identity, creating a communal whole that evolves throughout the exhibition.",
