      "longDescription": "This interactive installation transforms individual portraits into a collective-ever changing identity through a grid system. Participants step on a floor switch to trigger a countdo wn sequence, after which their por trait is captured, processed, and a single random cell is extracted from a 7×7 grid (overlaid on their face using ml5 face tr acking). This cell is printed on thermal paper using a custom dithering algorithm that converts full-color images to black and white while preserving visual quality. Participants then place their printed cell fragment on the corresponding coordinate of an illuminated lightbox display, gradually building a composite community portrait over time. As new contributions accumulate, earlier portraits become partially obscured, creating a layered timeline of collective portraits that visualizes the ever changing community identity. The project challenges self-representation by blurring the lines of individual identity, creating a communal whole that evolves throughout the exhibition.",
