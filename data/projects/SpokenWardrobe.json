As users speak, their words are converted to text, via Whisper (a browser-based speech recognition model run using Transformers.js), and appear around them in 3D space mimicking a sor t of magical incantation. These spoken wishes are then used to query a Stable Diffusion inpainting model that gene rates custom digital garments, baked on the user’s request, and overlays them onto the user ’s body; from dresses made of flames to suits of thorns and tr ee bark.",
